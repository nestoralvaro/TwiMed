The group assigned __number__ patients with untreated MM below __number__ years of age to receive VAD (vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone) as induction therapy and afterwards assigned these patients randomly to single or double transplantation conditioned by melphalan __number__ mg/m __number__ and TBI (standard single transplantation) or melphalan __number__ mg/m __number__ followed by __number__ mg/m __number__ and TBI (experimental double transplantation). __number__ Following a median observation of approximately six years, response rates in the two groups were not significantly different, but the probabilities of event free survival and overall survival were prolonged with a double transplant benefit that had not been evident in early analyses. __number__ This important study demonstrates that double transplantation is one of the options for treating myeloma, particularly those younger than __number__ years of age who have a suboptimal response to a single transplant.
