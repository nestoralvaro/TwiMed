RESULTS: Both doses of zileuton decreased the mean [SE] arrhythmia score (zileuton __number__ mg/kg:  __number__  [  __number__  ]; zileuton __number__ mg/kg:  __number__  [  __number__  ] vs control:  __number__  [  __number__  ]; P <  __number__  ), the duration of ventricular tachycardia, and the total length of arrhythmias, but montelukast was not effective to decrease the ventricular arrhythmias during the __number__ minutes of reperfusion.
